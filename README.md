# Bob der Kleinkriminelle

Welcome to **Bob der Kleinkriminelle** ‚Äî a student-created project designed to help computer science students understand the **Knapsack Problem** and its solutions using **Greedy** and **0/1 Knapsack** algorithms.

## About the Project

This project was developed as part of an **Algorithms and Data Structures** course, aiming to provide an educational and hands-on way to learn about solving optimization problems through classic algorithmic approaches.

The project centers around Bob, a small-time criminal, who wants to maximize his loot value without exceeding the weight limit of his backpack ‚Äî a playful scenario to bring the knapsack problem to life! The name "Bob der Kleinkriminelle" is a tongue-in-cheek reference to "Bob der Baumeister" (Bob the Builder), a beloved children's TV show in Germany.

## Features

- üß† **Knapsack Problem Visualization:** Understand the fundamental problem of selecting items with the highest value-to-weight ratio.
- ‚ö° **Greedy Algorithm Implementation:** Learn how a heuristic approach works for solving the problem quickly (though not always optimally).
- üì¶ **0/1 Knapsack Solution:** Explore the dynamic programming approach to find the exact optimal solution.
- üéÆ **Interactive Unity Game Tutorial:** A Unity-based game that acts as a step-by-step tutorial, guiding students through the Knapsack Problem in an engaging way.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/SomeLazyGuy/bob-der-kleinkriminelle.git
```

2. **Open in Unity:** Open the project folder in Unity Hub, and launch the game through the Unity editor (Unity version 2022.3.50f1).

3. **Play and Learn:**
   Play through different levels where you help Bob decide which items to steal, learning the differences between Greedy and 0/1 Knapsack strategies as you progress.

## Learning Outcomes

By exploring this project, you will:

- Grasp the concept of the **Knapsack Problem**.
- Understand the trade-offs between the **Greedy** approach and the **0/1 Knapsack** solution.
